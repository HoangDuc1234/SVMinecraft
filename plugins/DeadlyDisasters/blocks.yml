# Every strength is between 0.0-1.0 with 0 meaning will always break and 1.0 meaning it cannot be destroyed or moved
# Blocks are divided in categories and variants are included with some (example: setting oak_planks will set all variants such as oak stairs and slabs to the same strength)
# This does not include every block only the most common ones so feel free to add any blocks if you want (any blocks missing have a default strength of 0.0)
